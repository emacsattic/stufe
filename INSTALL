Basic Installation
==================

Two lines have to be add in the $HOME/.emacs to be able to use stufe :

1) The root folder of stufe has to be specified :

      (setq stufe-root "<where you have installed stufe>")

   For example : (setq stufe-root "~/stufe")


2) Then, we load stufe : 

      (load-file "<where you have installed stufe>/stufe.el")

   For example : (load-file "~/stufe/stufe.el")


I would advise to put these lines at the beginning of the .emacs file,
so Stufe won't overload settings you already have for Emacs (like
colors, keyboard shortcuts, ...).

Then, most of the functions of stufe are accessible from the Stufe
menu and from the Project menu (when Stufe functions are accessible
for a particular mode).
